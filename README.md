# Determining-Format-and-Forecasting-Sales
Determining the Format for the New Stores and Forecasting Produce Sales 

The project consists of three tasks namely. 1) Determining the Optimal Number of Store Formats, 2) Determining Formats for the New Stores, 3) Predicting Produce Sales

In this multi-stage project, I first analyzed the optimal number of store formats for a grocery store chain and then developed a model that predicts which segment a store falls into based on the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the population that resides in the area around each new store. In the last step I prepared a monthly forecast for produce sales for the full year for both existing and new stores.
